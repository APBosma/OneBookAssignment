		<p>The UT Arlington OneBook program is 
		delighted to be hosting a visit to campus by 
		Bill McKibben, the author of this year’s OneBook, <i>Deep Economy: 
		The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable 
		Future</i> (2007).</p>
		
		<p> McKibben is possibly the most 
		prolific, important and 
		influential environmental writer of our time. 
		His first book, <i>The End 
		of Nature</i> (1989), was a pioneering work of journalism on climate 
		change that was hailed by reviewers as a 
		compelling, must-read about the future of 
		our planet. Subsequent books, such as <i>Hope, 
		Human and Wild: True Stories of Living 
		Lightly on the Earth</i> (1995), <i>Maybe One: 
		A Case for Smaller Families</i> (1998) and 
		<i>Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered 
		Age</i> (2003) explore sustainability, population 
		growth and the perils of technology and genetic engineering.</p>
		
		<p>McKibben’s great stature 
		and contribution to American environmental 
		writing is evidenced by the recent publication of a retrospective collection of his essays 
		titled <i>The Bill McKibben Reader</i> (2008). Bill 
		McKibben is more than just writer, though; 
		he has been a tireless environmental activist. McKibben has led two of the largest protests 
		against global warming in U.S. history, one in 
		2006 and the other in 2007. McKibben also 
		founded Stepitup07.org, a website designed 
		to help pressure the U.S. government toward 
		more sustainable policies on carbon emissions.</p>
		
		<p>After reading and discussing <i>Deep 
		Economy</i>, join us to meet its accomplished 
		and fascinating author!</p>
