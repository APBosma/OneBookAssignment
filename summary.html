		<h2>Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable Future</h2>
		<p>
			The OneBook for 2009-2010 is <i>Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable Future</i> 
			(2007) by one of the greatest environmental writers and activists in the U.S., Bill McKibben. 
			In <i>Deep Economy</i>, you will read about how our globalized economy has become addicted to the ideas 
			of limitless economic growth and endless consumption of goods. As McKibben defines it, a deep
			 economy “cares less about quantity than quality [and] takes as its goal the production of human 
			 satisfaction as much as surplus material.”
		</p>
		<p>
			<i>Deep Economy</i> asserts that what we eat, what we drive, where we live and what we feel are
			 all related to how we use or misuse the earth’s resources. 
			This provocative book will make you think about how you live your life every day and will
			 challenge you to dream of a better future.
