        <h2>Central Theme: Sustainability</h2>
        <p>
            The OneBook theme for 2009-2010 is the central theme of <i>Deep Economy</i>: Sustainability. 
            Sustainability is the concept of using resources (such as fossil fuels or water) without 
            depleting or wasting them. Sustainability is about maintaining life and society through 
            technologies, policies and personal choices that help us use our planetâ€™s limited resources more effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of Sustainability encompasses several overlapping domains that we will explore 
            in this study guide, our multi-media resources and many presentations and activities on campus. 
            We have prepared several icons to designate these domains, and to publicize on-campus events that 
            you will find helpful as you study the topic of Sustainability.
        </p>

            <li><img src="Pictures/commerce.png" alt="Dollar Sign"><p>Our economic system drives the production, transport and 
				sale of goods, whether they be laptops, shoes or packaged 
				candy. These goods, as delivered to us as consumers by our 
				globalized economy, are directly related to energy and the environment. To lead a more sustainable life, economies will have to adapt to 
				new paradigms and we will have to change how we purchase and 
				consume goods.</p><br></li>
            <li><img src="Pictures/community.png" alt="Community"><p>It may not be obvious at first sight, but unsustainable 
                living affects how we interact with one another. For example, our dependence on oil has resulted in vast 
                metropolitan areas with few places for individuals to gather and meet each other, and in solitary car commutes. 
                A more sustainable lifestyle holds the promise of building and maintaining closer-knit communities.
            </p><br></li>
			<li><img src="Pictures/energy.png" alt="The Sun"><p>How will we acquire and maintain the energy needed to 
				fuel the production and movement of goods, and to power 
				our homes and communities? Wise, efficient energy usage 
				is key to sustainability, as is the search and development of alternate 
				sources of energy such as biofuels, wind and solar power.</p><br></li>
			<li><img src="Pictures/environment.png" alt="Three leaves overlapping"><p>Everything we do as residents on this planet impacts the 
				environment. The environment includes natural resources 
				like water, oil, forests, plants and animals. The choices we 
				make today will affect our environment and its ability to sustain our 
				survival on planet.</p><br></li>
